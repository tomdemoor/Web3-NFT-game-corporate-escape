# Create your own mini turn-based NFT browser game by Buildspace.so 

## About This Project
This is an async, weekend project for curious devs that want to learn more about crypto + gaming by hacking together their own web3 game. You'll mint your own NFTs, make them playable characters in your game, and let users earn your own crypto as they win games. I recommend giving this a try if you are interested in Web3.
